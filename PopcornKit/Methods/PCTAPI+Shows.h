/**
 Loads Shows from the API.
 
 @param page        The page number to load.
 @param filter      Sort the response by Popularity, Year, Date Rating, Alphabet or Trending.
 @param genre       Only return shows that match the provided genre.
 @param query       Only return shows that match the provided string.
 @param order       Ascending or descending.
 @param callback    The block called when the request completes. If the request completes successfully, an array of `PCTPartialShow` objects will be returned, however, if it fails, the underlying error will be returned.
 
 @note  This method returns `PCTPartialShow` objects and not full `PCTShow` objects. `PCTPartialShow` can be promoted to full `PCTShow` objects by calling `getShowForImdbID:callback:` passing in the IMDB ID obtained from the `PCTPartialShow` object.
 
 @return    The request's `NSURLSessionTask` to be resumed.
